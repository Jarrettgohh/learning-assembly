1. using gdb commmand on the .c file name opens up pwndbg if its installed
2. basic assembly commands to use in pwndbg -> cmp, jmp, disass, eax, etc...
3. source code for .c file in github -> "cloudhacks-bof
4. important register to overwrite -> EIP

STEPS in BOF
1. overwrite buffer
2. place memory address of intended function in the EIP -> placing the address at the end of the buffer
3. bad characters
4. shellcode -> return to smth

1. Info function -> shows all functions within the binary
2. disass -> disassemble function
3. b *<memory address> -> add a breakppoint
